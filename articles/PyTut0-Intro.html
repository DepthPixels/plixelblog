          In today's world the importance of having the ability to code a program or computer is increasing exponentially as the world turns digital. To perform programming or more commonly known as 'coding' you must be able to understand and write one or more 'programming languages'. One of these programming languages is the one we're covering in our tutorial, it's known as 'Python' and is a very powerful language with a gentle learning curve for beginners. The demand for programmers who can write Python is currently increasing greatly and many foretell that it will rise even more in the near future.
          <br><br>
          In Python Programmers use Function Names to call predefined functions or custom-made ones. Like in the example below the function
          <code>print()</code>
          is being called to 'print' something to the console.
          <br><br>
          <ol class="code">
            <li class="t0">print("Hello There!")</li>
          </ol>
          The Output would look something like this:
          <blockquote>Hello There!</blockquote>
